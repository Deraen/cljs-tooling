# cljs-tooling

[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gtrak/cljs-tooling.png)](http://travis-ci.org/gtrak/cljs-tooling)

A Clojure library designed to provide tooling support for ClojureScript.
Currently it provides var info and auto-completion based on compiler state.

It is the basis for clojurescript source navigation in clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl, but is separate for the sake of test-harnesses, decoupled development.

## Artifacts

With leiningen:

     [cljs-tooling "0.1.4"]

## Usage

```clojure
;; env is pulled from cljs compiler state
=> (completions @cljs.env/*compiler* "al" 'cljs.core)
("alength" "alter-meta!")
```
